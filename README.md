# Redux and React

Redux is best described as a predictable wrapper for JavaScript application state. It is a tool to facilitate the use of states within an application, it has a global and immutable state, and in turn a greater control of this same stored state.

As it interacts with React, well it facilitates the creation of applications with the React library, since it centralizes the use of the state, and by functioning as a container of states, what it does is facilitate the use of the state between components, it is simpler than a child component connects directly to Redux to use a state, which go through several sibling components to reach this same state.
